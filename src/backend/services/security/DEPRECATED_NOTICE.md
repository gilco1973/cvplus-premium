# DEPRECATED SECURITY SERVICES

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE

The `rate-limit-guard.service.ts` file in this directory has been **DEPRECATED** and renamed to `.deprecated` due to **CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES**.

### Security Issues Identified:
- **Fail-open behavior**: Service allowed access when rate limiting failed
- **Memory-only storage**: No distributed rate limiting capability
- **Inconsistent security policies**: Different behavior than secure implementation

### Replacement:
All rate limiting functionality has been **CONSOLIDATED** into the secure implementation in:
```
@cvplus/core/services/security/rate-limit-guard.service.ts
```

### Migration:
All imports should now use:
```typescript
import { SecureRateLimitGuard, secureRateLimitGuard } from '@cvplus/core';
```

### Security Policy:
The new consolidated service implements a **fail-closed security policy** that:
- Denies access when rate limiting services fail
- Uses Firestore for distributed rate limiting
- Provides consistent security logging and monitoring
- Maintains audit trails for all security events

### DO NOT RESTORE:
This vulnerable implementation should **NEVER** be restored to production.
All security services must use the consolidated core implementation.
